# Student Performance Analysis

## Introduction
In this analysis, we aim to explore how various factors influence students' performance improvements over time. The primary objective is to predict whether a student's exam score will improve based on a set of characteristics and prior performance metrics. By examining the relationship between these factors and the improvement in exam scores, we can gain insights into the drivers of academic success.

Our dataset includes a range of variables such as hours studied, attendance, parental involvement, and previous scores. By analyzing these variables, we seek to identify patterns and factors that contribute to an increase in students' exam scores. This analysis will help us understand which aspects of students' educational experiences have the most significant impact on their academic performance, potentially guiding educational strategies and interventions to enhance student outcomes.
